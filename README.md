# Coursera IBM Data Analysis Specialization - Course 5 Final Project

This repository contains the code and resources for the final project of Course 5 in the IBM Data Analysis Professional Certificate on Coursera.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on extracting and visualizing historical stock data and revenue data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME). The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in data acquisition using both the `yfinance` library and web scraping techniques, followed by data manipulation and visualization to gain insights into the companies' financial performance.

Specifically, this project addressed the following questions:

* Extracting Tesla and GameStop stock data using `yfinance`.
* Web scraping Tesla and GameStop revenue data from web sources.
* Visualizing the historical stock prices and revenue trends for both companies.

This project demonstrates the following skills:

* Data acquisition using `yfinance` and web scraping.
* Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas.
* Data manipulation and analysis using Pandas.
* Data visualization using Matplotlib.

## Files

* `Final Assignment.ipynb`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the Python code for the project.
* `README.md`: This file.

## Libraries Used

* Pandas
* yfinance
* BeautifulSoup4
* Requests
* Matplotlib

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas yfinance beautifulsoup4 requests matplotlib
    ```
3.  Open and run the `Final Assignment.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

The project successfully extracted and visualized the historical stock prices and revenue data for Tesla and GameStop. The visualizations provide insights into the fluctuations in stock prices and the trends in revenue over time. Key findings include the annual revenue of each company, and the historical share price. The graphs display the financial trends.

## Further Information

This project utilizes publicly available data from Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance`) and web scraping from publicly accessible web pages.
